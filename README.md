CVPR 2023 "Are Binary Annotations Sufficient? Video Moment Retrieval via Hierarchical Uncertainty-based Active Learning"


![overview](/images/architecture.png)

## Prerequisites
- pip install 

## Preparation
The visual features of `Charades-STA` and `ActivityNet Captions` are available at [Box Drive](
https://app.box.com/s/d7q5atlidb31cuj1u8znd7prgrck1r1s).

Download the word embeddings from [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip). Modify the path setting in `./configs/charades/SeqPAN.yaml`.

Download the anet initiate pkl from https://app.box.com/s/mlcxc8oq3zanz2mzamze0hb9yyt51ij8, put it to ./results/anet/re0.pkl

Directory hierarchies are shown below:

## Quick Start
**Train**
```shell script
python run_charades.py
python run_anet.py

# it include three step:
# 1. Update pseudo label.
# 2. Train model.
# 3. Infer prediction of train dataset.

```
